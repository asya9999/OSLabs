Recovery:
Through preemption:it takes a resource from other process. It DEPENDS on nature of the resource and the process 
Through rollback: it checkpoints a process periodically. The process can be restart, if it was deadlocked. It consumes time and space
Through killing process: it kills one of the processes in the deadlock cycle. But it is crude, because there may be problems, depending on processes being returnable 

Prevention:
prevent Deadlock by eliminating any of 4 condition (Mutual exclusion, Hold and wait, No preemption, Circular wait)
It is at least possible, holds the goal of preventing deadlocks

Avoidance:
disallow deadlock by trying to determine if allowing a particular resource allocation will cause deadlock 
It can often be impossible practically, because we need to know information in advance
